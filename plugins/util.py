â€¢ Provisional Bayesian Elo for your first 5 games beause it's more accurate. https://www.remi-coulom.fr/Bayesian-Elo/. But at the same time, it's most effective when a small number of games are played and computationally expensive. https://www.warzone.com/Forum/362170-bayesian-elo-versus-regular-elo
â€¢ Staff commands parameters should be an option within the slash command
â€¢ Give better instructions with /help
â€¢ Link staff roles with discord role
â€¢ Automatically assign roles based on Elo
Players are unranked until provisional elo is done (2 games)
â€¢ /configure option to select map when match starts, and /map choose random map
â€¢ remove player from queue after 10 mins
â€¢ show when opponent declares result, and when there's a conflict
â€¢ /join records match time
â€¢ /history show your recent matches
â€¢ see distribution of everyone's elo
â€¢ /stats show your percentile
â€¢ Associate each match with a message id in match announcements, so that message can be edited
â€¢ /compare (player) show your expected probability of beating opponent. Elo change for winning and losing 
â€¢ make displayed results pretty
â€¢ make a better bot icon
â€¢ shorthand for commands ex. declare match results /d"""

Actual Matchmaking. When you join the queue, you get matched with people of similar elo, and the longer you wait, the broader the search.

Ability to change old match results. When your elo change depends on the elo difference, fixing the result of an old match (for whatever reason, maybe it was declared wrong or someone was caught boosting and their impact needs to be reverted) has a cascading effect on all the subsequent players those players played against, and the players they played against, and so on... since your elo change depends on your and your opponent's prior elo."""
