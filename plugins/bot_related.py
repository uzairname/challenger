Actual Matchmaking. When you join the queue, you get matched with people of similar elo, and the longer you wait, the broader the search

Ability to change old match results. When your elo change depends on the elo difference, fixing the result of an old match (for whatever reason, maybe it was declared wrong or someone was caught boosting and their impact needs to be reverted) has a cascading effect on all the subsequent players those players played against, and the players they played against, and so on... since your elo change depends on your and your opponent's prior elo."""
